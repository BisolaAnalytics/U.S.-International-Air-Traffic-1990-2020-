About Dataset 
Content 
The data comes from the U.S. International Air Passenger and Freight Statistics Report. As part of the T
100 program, USDOT receives traffic reports of US and international airlines operating to and from US 
airports. There are two datasets available: 

Departures: Data on all flights between US gateways and non-US gateways, irrespective of origin and 
destination. 
Each observation provides information on a specific airline for a pair of airports, one in the US and the other 
outside. Three main columns record the number of flights: Scheduled, Charter, and Total. 

Passengers: Data on the total number of passengers for each month and year between a pair of airports, 
as serviced by a particular airline. 
U.S. International Air Passenger and Freight data are confidential for a period of 6 months, after which it 
can be released. As a result, quarterly reports and the year to date/calendar year raw data files available 
here will always lag by two quarters.
